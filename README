                Evoluting Turing machines


I) What is turev ?

Turev is a project aimed to find busy beavers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver ). It uses evolutionary computing on a population of Turing machines with same characteristics.
Turev is written in C++.

II) Does it Work ?

We just started the developpement so we have no results for the moment.

III) Can I Try It ?

Of course. Just run `git clone git@github.com:emmmile/machine-learning.git` to copy the files on your computer, and then `make`. If you are lucky, it will compile fine without missing dependencies.

IV) How Can I Get More Info About It ?

You can read our wiki (https://github.com/emmmile/machine-learning/wiki ). You can also click on `Watch` at the right top of the webpage https://github.com/emmmile/machine-learning .
